General Information
===================
Implementation of an algorithm for determining differential flat ouputs
for nonlinear dynamic systems [1]. For further information on how
to use this package, see doc/user_guide.pdf.

An example has been implemented in the following IPython Notebook:
`Gantry crane <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/klim-/uc_algorithm/blob/master/AT_gantry%20crane/brueckenkran.ipynb>`_

Installation
============
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- sympy
- numpy
- symbtools
- pycartan

It is recommended to install these using the Python Package Index PyPI::

    $ pip install sympy numpy symbtools pycartan

Install uc_algorithm by cloning the repo::

    $ git clone https://github.com/klim-/uc_algorithm.git
